You are on your regular hiking trail, trekking into the lush tropical rainforest, wading across streams and hearing the atmospheric sounds of nature. Although you've been here for the umpteenth time, there's always something new you'll discover. It's what you've always loved about the trail.

While treading along the river line, you spotted an object which seemed to be partially buried into the ground. Curious, you decided to check it out. While uncovering the dirt surrounding it, you unearthed a peculiar device, which seemed like a portable music player of the early 2000s. You checked for a power button, found it, and switched it on. 

BEEP. 

It seemed to be powered on, judging by the sound it made. The dainty screen popped up a message:

YOU HAVE FOUND ME. I HOLD THE WORLD'S SECRETS OF HUMANKIND KNOWLEDGE OF THE 21ST CENTURY. YOU MAY CHOOSE THE OPTIONS BELOW TO BEGIN. BUT BE WARNED. THESE ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

You read the eerie forewarning, and you looked at the options below and decided to choose one of them.
